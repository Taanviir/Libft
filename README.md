# Libft
This is the first project in the 42cursus that a student faces in 42AbuDhabi. The aim of the project is to make a library that contains generic functions which will be used later on in future projects.
After finishing my Libft, I did the next two projects, ft_printf (where I had to partially recreate printf) and get_next_line (which basically parses and returns the first line from a text file). Since finishing these projects I have added them to my libft. 

To use any of these functions, simply add
```
#include "(header file).h"
```
and the function in your C program, use make to create the library and then compile with the library.
